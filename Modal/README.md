## Modal

A `<Modal>` component for react-native.

### Usage

1. `var Modal = require('react-uikit/Modal');`
2. At the bottom of your app, add the `<Modal>` element and use its
   `isVisible` prop to toggle visibility. It needs to be at the bottom
   so that it appears above all other components when it is visible.
